    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, my name is Hannah Endalk. I'm 23 years old, I was born on the 22<sup>nd</sup> of april 2002 and currently live in Ottawa. I was born here, but my ethnicity is Ethiopian. When I was seven, my family decided to move back to Ethiopia, and <em>I'm very grateful</em> we did because it gave me the chance to <em>connect deply with my culture</em>. We returned to ottawa when I was 17, where I completed my high school education, and now I am pursuing my studes in college. I choose <abbr title="Interative Media Design">IMD</abbr> program because I wanted a field a field that combines creativity and problem - solving. I was searching for a program that I could create with purpose, and IMD felt like the perfect fit.</p>
    <p>I would describe myself as someone still discovering my strenghs and interests. I am eager to start a program that will help me grow, both creativly and professionally, while making a positive impact on others. I am ready to embrace any task or project that challenges me and allows me to learn, experiment and contribute. I hope this program will give me tools and experiences I need to combine creativity with purpose and make a meaningful difference.</p>
