    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, my name is Hannah Endalk. I'm 23 years old and currently live in Ottawa. I was born here, but my ethnicity is Ethiopian. When I was seven, my family decided to move back to Ethiopia, and I'm very grateful we did because it gave me the chance to connect deply with my culture. We returned to ottawa when I was 17, where I completed my high school education, and now I am pursuing my studes in college. I choose IMD program because I wanted a field a field that combines creativity and problem - solving. I was searching for a program that I could create with purpose, and IMD felt like the perfect fit.</p>
    <p>I would describe myself as someone still discovering my strenghs and interests. I am eager to start a program that will help me grow, both creativly and professionally, while making a positive impact on others. I am ready to embrace any task or project that challenges me and allows me to learn, experiment and contribute. I hope this program will give me tools and experiences I need to combine creativity with purpose and make a meaningful difference.</p>
